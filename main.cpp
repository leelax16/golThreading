 * GOL THREADING PROJECT                                        Created 6/16/22
 * 
 * This is a personal project for me to practice threading using C++. This 
 * project is based on some coursework I did at Swarthmore where he built a GOL
 * simulator using C and pthread libraries. I am also trying to practice 
 * using graphics libraries and my target is to learn SDL2.
